I'm a Data and Software Engineer with experience in Earth Science Data Handling, Satellite Data Manipulation, Non-structured Data Processing and more... Since 10, I'm trying to understand how to improve my coding style. Sometimes it works well, sometimes is better than expected!

Sometime in the Past, I worked as an Earth Engine Specialist, and I had the chance to present my work about deforestation detection at the Google's California Head Quarter!

And, after that, I worked on Satellite Data processing, from the raw ingestion to image delivering in a Public Service in Brazil.

🌱 Currently learning: Rust, Python and Data Engineering
